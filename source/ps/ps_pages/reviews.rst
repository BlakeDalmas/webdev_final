PlayStation
-----------

Being the most sold gaming console it can be deemed the most successful console
and to many people the best overall gaming device. Overall the consensus on the
PlayStation consoles have been very positive and PlayStation is likely to continue
to dominate the console market for the foreseeable future.

With the PS4 being one of the best consoles on the market it is no surprise that 
many of the reviews of the device appraise it for its revolutionizing software and 
UI. Although not everyone is a fan of the PS4 many would agree that the positives
outweigh the negatives. One of the biggest complaints is that it doesn't contain
the wireless standards and instead relies on an 802.11b/g/n radio at 2.4 GHz.
With some complaints at the release of the PS4 Sony listened to the people and
added some of the features that were missing at their release including support
for Bluetooth headphones.
