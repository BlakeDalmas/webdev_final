called the PSP which released in 2005. With a history as long as Playstation's 
there is a lot to learn about this console that is now a household name and owned
by millions. 

PlayStation 1
-------------

As I mentioned before the PS1 came out December of 1994 and changed the gaming 
industry forever. This started a trend of owning your own gaming consoles and this
trend has grown to the extent where almost every household owns at least some kind 
of gaming console.

PlayStation Portable
--------------------

Unlike previous consoles in the PlayStation series the PSP was a portable version
of their gaming consoles which primarily competed with the widely popular Nintendo
DS. It released in 2004 and became the most powerful portable system on release
making it the only real competitor to the Nintendo DS which had been dominating 
hand-held game console market.
