History
=======

The Playstation has been around since the first installment of it the PS1 in 1994.
Since this start they have made 3 major additions with the latest being the PS4, 
which was released in 2013 and has had a few refreshes since this release. Along 
with these main gaming consoles they also released a portable version of their console
called the PSP which released in 2005. With a history as long as Playstation's 
there is a lot to learn about this console that is now a household name and owned
by millions. 

Playstation 1
-------------

As I mentioned before the PS1 came out December of 1994 and changed the gaming 
industry forever. This started a trend of owning your own gaming consoles and this
trend has grown to the extent where almost every household owns at least some kind 
of gaming console.
