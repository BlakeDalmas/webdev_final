History
=======


The Nintendo Wii was first released in 2006 by the Nintendo Company in Japan. Shortly before the release of the Wii, Nintendo was being taken over by other gaming systems, such as the Xbox and PlayStation 3. However, the release of the Wii provided a low-cost gaming system that featured multiplayer "party" games and soon became a go-to party game. The Wii quickly established the largest user base of all gaming systems.
