many exciting games available for the Wii, including popular games such as 
*Mario Kart*, *Super Smash Bros*, *Just Dance*, and many more! This game also 
promotes healthier living and lifestyles. It requires the user be moving in 
order to play the games. There are all many games, such as Wii Fitness, that
