Nintendo Company was founded in 1889 in Japan. Since then, they have created some of the top-selling gaming systems and games. Nintendo became a video game company in the 1970s after their attempts at other businesses. Now, they are one of Japan's most well-known companies and have a market value of over $85 billion.

History
-------
Fusajiro Yamauchi founded Nintendo first as a playing card company. The company quickly took off and began to mass produce cards. The name, "Nintendo" was first introduced in 1949. Yamauchi's grandson, Hiroshi Yamauchi realized that the playing card business was not a very wide business and started to look into other areas the company could pursue. Over the years, they attempted taxi, love hotel chains, TV network, food company, and many other businesses. In 1966, the company tried the toy industry. They created a few popular toys, but overall, they were not having a large among of success until they shifted focuses and came out with the Laser Clay Shooting System. After the success of this product, Nintendo released many other light gun machines for arcades.

Video Game Industry
-------------------
In 1974, Nintendo ventured into the gaming industry and distributed the Magnavox Odyssey video game console. In 1975, the company moved into video arcade games and hired their first game designer. They had success, but nothing compared to the success they gained from the release of *Donkey Kong* in 1981. This was designed by Miyamoto and launched Nintendo's profits and popularity. In 1979, the idea of the first handheld video game was originated by Gunpei Yokoi. The first device to be released was *Game & Watch* in 1980. The hardware was tied to the game because it did not have interchangeable games. This became rather popular and the design was soon patented by Nintendo. Since then, Nintendo has produced many other gaming systems and become a globally known name.
