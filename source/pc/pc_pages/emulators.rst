Emulators
=========

While you can always play PC games through a digital distribution platform like
Steam, or by some other means. What if you wanted to play a console game on your
computer that isn't supported on PC?

Explanation
-----------
Emulators allow you to play games exclusive for consoles on your computer. 
Emulators, as the name implies, are programs that emulate the console onto the 
computer. Essentially, the program mimics how the console would work so it can 
run on the computer. For example, you can run an emulation of a Nintendo 64 on 
the PC and play N64 games on the emulator. Most emulators are designed for older
consoles. However, there are some exceptions such as Cemu.

Cemu is an in-development emulator that emulates the Wii U. You can play famous
titles on it such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario
3D World. Cemu also introduces new features such as 4k resolution support and
increased frame-rates. However, since it's still being developed, the emulator
has some stability issues and certain games will not work correctly on it.
