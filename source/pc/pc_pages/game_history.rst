Games and History
=================

Throughout the history of PC gaming, many titles have been released that had a
profound effect on the video game industry. This section only scratches the
surface with a few notable examples. 

The First Game
--------------

One of the earliest examples of a video game is, "Tennis for Two" which was
designed in 1958 for the Donner Model 30 Analog Computer. The game was displayed 
on an oscilloscope and featured a simple match of tenis.

   In Tennis for Two, you play a side-view of tennis. The ball uses actual 
   trajectories supported by the Donner Model 30 Analog Computer.

Text-Adventure Games
--------------------

Eventually, there came other famous examples such as Pong and Pacman. However,
some of the earliest examples of PC games were the text-adventure games.
Specifically, the first known example, "Colossal Cave Adventure" was made in 
1976 by Will Crowther for the PDP-10 Mainframe.

   In this game, you type in text commands to navigate a cave filled with
   treasure. You are assigned points based on what happens in the cave.

DOOM
----

Over time, as computers got more advanced, games with actual graphics were
released and popularised. One of the most influential examples in PC gaming
history was, "DOOM". Doom was released in 1993 by ID Software and ran on MS-DOS.

   Doom is a fast-paced first person shooter where you kill endless hordes
   of demons.

Morrowind
---------

This technology continued to advance and in 2002 games with much larger maps
and playable areas were being released. An example of this is, "The Elder
Scrolls III : Morrowind", one of my personal favorites. Morrowind is an 
open-world action RPG that takes pace in a strange alien-like world accompanied
with giant mushrooms, volcanoes, and interesting geography. There's hundreds of 
quests, items, NPCs, and interesting things to discover. The graphics for the 
game, as seen below, were impressive at the time. This game helped popularise 
the Elder Scrolls franchise, further setting the scene for even more sucessful 
titles like Oblivion and Skyrim.

   In Morrowind, you start as a Prisoner on a ship who receives a vision warning
   of the blight at Red Mountain. Your quest is to fulfill the prophecy of
   killing Dagoth Ur and ending the blight afflicting the people of Vvardenfell.

Half-Life 2
-----------

Shortly after, accompanied with the advent of Steam. A game was released that
had the same levels of influence that DOOM had. This game arguably shaped the 
future of video games for years to come. Half-Life 2 was released in 2004 and 
brought revolutionary graphics, physics, AI, and more to the video game 
industry. To this day, Half-Life 2 is still played and modded through platforms 
such as Garry's Mod and Synergy.

   In Half-Life 2, you play as the theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman. After
   the events at Black Mesa in Half-Life 1, you find yourself in City 17 under
   the dystopian control of the Combine. You join forces with the resistance
   to fight through hordes of Combine Soldiers and zombies in the persuit of
   destroying these multidimensional overlords.

Team Fortress 2
---------------

Around this time, the popularity of multiplayer games was increasing. 
World of Warcraft, Unreal Tournament, and other popular titles were 
being played across the world. In 2007, Valve, the creators of Half-Life 2, 
released Team Fortress 2. TF2 featured a unique art style, and to this day, the
game is still regularly played and updated.

   Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer team-based PvP first person shooter with 9
   different classes to choose from. Later on, the game would include hundreds
   of different weapons and hats you could equip as well.

Minecraft
---------

In 2009, Minecraft was released by Markus Persson. This would turn out to be one
of the most successful video games in history. With 154 million copies sold,
Minecraft is the second-best selling video game of all time, only being beaten 
by Tetris.

   Minecraft is a sandbox game with an infinite procedurally generated world.
   The entire game is made of blocks you can destroy and place, allowing you
   to manipulate the world into an unlimited variety of structures and
   buildings.

CS:GO
-----

In 2012, Valve released Counter-Strike : Global Offensive (CS:GO). This game was
a major contributor for setting the scene of highly competitive multiplayer
video games, eventually leading to the popularisation and creation of ESports.
As you can see in the picture below, the graphics of video games reached very
high levels around this time.

   CS:GO is a highly competitive multiplayer first person shooter. 
   Two teams of 6 players take turns playing as either the Terrorists or 
   Counter-Terrorists. The Terrorists try to blow up a site with a bomb and 
   the Counter-Terrorists try to prevent this from happening.

DOOM 2016
---------

Past this point, more and more interesting video games with new and unique
concepts continued to be released. Games such as Borderlands 2, Skyrim, 
Warframe, Farcry, GTA V, and much more. The graphics of these games continued to 
improve and new technology such as realtime ray-tracing was introduced. 
Currently, games like Fortnite and Overwatch are the most popular. 
However, I would like to end this where it began. In 2016, ID Software partnered 
with Bethesda and released a modern version of the original DOOM. If you look
at a side-by-side comparison of the two, you can easily see just how far
video game graphics and technology has come since then.
