Xbox Sales
----------
Microsoft does not make a lot of money selling consoles. At the initial release, the Xbox one consoles sold for $499 but it cost the company $471 to make each console - only a $28 profit. It makes most of the profits from Xbox from the Xbox Live Service. Xbox Live cost $40 every year for a subscription and had 48 million subscribers in 2017. That results in a profit of around $1.92 billion dollars every year.
